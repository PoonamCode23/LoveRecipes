**LoveRecipes**

An evolving Online Recipe Sharing Website built with Django.

I'm actively developing this project and committing updates almost daily! ðŸ˜Š

**Project Overview**

LoveRecipes is a web application where users can share and discover different recipes. It includes features like user authentication and authorization, recipe CRUD operations and there are still many ongoing additions of new features.

**MySQL Database**

This project utilizes a MySQL database for storing recipe data. For setup, an SQL file named "recipes_database.sql" is included in the buildDjango directory. This file contains all the necessary schema and initial data required to successfully run the project.
