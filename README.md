**LoveRecipes**

An evolving Online Recipe Sharing Website built with Django.

I'm actively developing this project and committing updates almost daily! ðŸ˜Š

**Project Overview**

LoveRecipes is a web application where users can share and discover different recipes. It includes features like user authentication and authorization, searching recipes, recipe CRUD operations, saving recipes and there are still many ongoing additions of new features.

**MySQL Database**

This project utilizes a MySQL database for storing recipe data. For setup, an SQL file named "recipes_database.sql" is included in the main directory. This file contains all the necessary schema and initial data required to successfully run the project.
